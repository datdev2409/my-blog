## Welcome

This is the log of everything I am learning right now. I capture raw notes, polished write-ups, and the in-between thoughts that shape how I build products and software.

### What You Will Find

- Running notes from experiments, courses, and books I am working through.
- Clear summaries once a topic clicks, so future me (and maybe you) can revisit it fast.
- Occasional meta reflections on learning systems, productivity, and creative practice.
