I started my personal blog today (01/01/2026). Here are some reasons for me to start this blog

1. To capture my raw notes from daily learning sessions
2. To collect the how-to documentations. So I can easily shared them with other people
3. To reflect on my journey to become better in software development field

Here is to many small notes adding up to something meaningful. Let us see where it goes.
