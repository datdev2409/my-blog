title: Why I start this blog

Today is the first day of 2026, and I am turning this blank space into a living notebook. I want a place where I can capture the raw notes from daily learning sessions, the experiments that worked, the ones that failed, and the small wins that tend to disappear in scattered docs.

This blog is primarily for me, but if someone else drops by and learns something useful, even better. Expect:

- Quick recaps of things I am studying or building.
- Practical how-to pages once I have repeated a process enough times to explain it clearly.
- Occasional reflections on how I am structuring my learning routines.

Each post will stay short and actionable. The goal is speed and usefulness, not polished essays. Future me (or you) should be able to land on any post and pull out a concrete idea in under five minutes.

Here is to many small notes adding up to something meaningful. Let us see where it goes.
